# Bin detangling

This is a work-in-progress collection of scripts for the refinement of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using a combination of emergent self-organising maps (ESOM) and machine-learning algorithms. This is not intended to work as a single all-in-one package, as there are too many stages to refinement that require user intervention and judgement calls. Instead, this repository is a collection of scripts that are called together to walk through a series of pre-computed bins and coverage files to achieve the outcome.

The documentation will improve as scripts are finalised and the workflow is validated.
